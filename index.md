Iâ€™m Jules, currently working as a Software Engineer @[Dust](https://dust.tt).

I previously worked as a researcher at Microsoft, on anomaly detection in high dimensional time series. Then fell in
love with all things Transformers and developed to NLP pipeline at [Hypefactors](https://hypefactors.com/). We dealt
with ~1B inferences/day on multi-lingual problems like NER and reputation analysis. As a side gig I worked on a few OSS
repository mostly around NLP and how to speed-up Transformer based models.
